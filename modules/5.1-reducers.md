# State and reducers

When a state grows, maintaining and keeping and overview of it can quickly become hard. Especially in a global context! To help manage these kind of complex state we can use a pattern called reducers. Typically reducers are pure functions that accepts two parameters: A state and an action. The return of the function is a new version of the state after the action has been applied. This gives a consistent immutable state management and can help maintain larger complex states.

```tsx
const lightSwitchReducer = (
  state: { lightswitch: "on" | "off"; color?: string },
  action: { type: "turn-on" | "turn-off"; payload?: { color?: string } }
) => {
  if (type === "turn-on")
    return {
      ...state,
      lightswitch: "on",
      color: payload?.color,
    };
  if (type === "turn-off")
    return {
      ...state,
      lightswitch: "off",
      color: undefined,
    };
  return state;
};

// In your component
const MyLightSwitch: FC = () => {
  const [lightswitchState, dispatch] = useReducer(lightSwitchReducer, {
    lightswitch: "off",
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <span style={{ backgroundColor: lightswitchState.color }}>
        {lightswitchState.lightswitch}
      </span>
      <button
        onClick={dispatch({ type: "turn-on", payload: { color: "red" } })}
      >
        On
      </button>
      <button onClick={dispatch({ type: "turn-off" })}>Off</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Some good learning material [react.dev](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context)

## Tasks:

1. Refactor the state in the `AuthContext` to instead of using `useState` it should now use a reducer.
2. Take a look at the your state for articles. Can you create a global state with context and reducers for this functionality?
