# E2E Testing

## Purpose

Our users doesn't care about our code, they care about our solution working. To make sure it's working we can use e2e testing software to simulate an actually browser and test our application as if a user where using it. For this module we will use [playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).

## Tasks

1. Start by installing playwright
2. Change your playwright.config.ts to match your server port.
3. Write a test to check that we actually show articles on the front page.
4. Write a test to log a user in by making playwright fill in the form and submitting the form.
